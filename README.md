# 🐝 Hive Game

This project is a full-stack implementation of the game **Hive**. Hive is an abstract strategy game for two players. Each player controls a set of bugs; Queen Bee, Beetles, Spiders, Ants, and Grasshoppers. They must surround the opponent’s Queen to win. This implementation currently includes the base game (expansion bugs like Ladybug, Mosquito, and Pill bug planned).

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python (Poetry and FastAPI)
- **Frontend**: React (TypeScript)
- **Testing**: Test suite with `pytest`
- **Design**: Clean, extensible object-oriented architecture with well-structured, readable code
- **Pattern**: MVC-style separation of logic, API, and view

## 🛠 Getting Started

### Set Up Backend

```bash
# Install Poetry if needed
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -

# Enter backend folder
cd backend

# Install dependencies
make install

# Run the backend server (http://localhost:8000)
make run
```

### Set Up Frontend

```bash
# To be addded

> Note: Both the frontend and backend must be running simultaneously for the game to function properly.
