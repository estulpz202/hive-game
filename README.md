# 🐝 Hive Game

This project is a full-stack implementation of the game **Hive**. It features a Python backend using modern tools and a modular React frontend.

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python with Poetry and FastAPI (planned)
- **Frontend**: React (TypeScript, planned)
- **Testing**: test suite with `pytest`
- **Design**: Clean, extensible object-oriented architecture with well-structured, readable code
- **Pattern**: MVC-style separation of logic, API, and view

## 🎮 Game Rules

Hive is an abstract strategy game for two players. Each player controls a set of bugs, Queen Bee, Beetles, Spiders, Ants, and Grasshoppers, and must surround the opponent’s Queen to win. This implementation currently includes the base game (expansion bugs like Ladybug and Mosquito planned).
